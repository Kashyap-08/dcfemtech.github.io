<h2>5th Annual DCFemTech Awards Recognize 49 Influential Individuals in Code, Data and Design</h2>

_Record Number of Nominations Reflects Burgeoning Inclusive Tech Community_

**May 23, 2019 —Washington, DC—** [DCFemTech](https://dcfemtech.com), the coalition of leaders aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for women in tech and increasing their career opportunities, today recognized 49 women and nonbinary individuals as [2019 DCFemTech Award recipients](dcfemtech.com/awards). These awards honor Washington’s top tech talent who are helping to build the area’s fastest-growing companies and most impactful nonprofit organizations. On June 17, the organization and its members will host a reception at The Hamilton Live to celebrate the recipients and nominees.

Nominations for outstanding women in code, design and data opened on March 6 at the organization’s annual Inspire event, an evening dedicated to encouraging women to share and celebrate accomplishments from the previous year. The organization received a record 704 nominations, representing a nearly 80 percent increase in nominations from two years prior.

"These incredible recipients and the hundreds of nominees represent a vibrant community of talented women in Washington, DC," said DC Government CTO Lindsey Parker. “While DC is ahead of the curve with the community and resources available for women in technology, efforts like this will only continue to make DC a more welcoming and inclusive environment for future innovation”

DCFemTech works to support organizations that enable women to build their skills and create communities while also encouraging companies to make it a priority to hire talented women coders, designers, data scientists and other tech leaders.

"Washington, DC continues to rank as the best city in the nation for women in technology and DCFemTech has played an instrumental role in fostering our inclusive tech ecosystem," said Brian Kenner, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development. “We applaud the work of individuals who are focused on ensuring our tech scene remains vibrant and competitive as this helps foster economic growth and attract the most innovative companies and top talent to DC.”

Nominations were downselected by a committee of 45 judges comprised of engineers, designers, data scientists, and executives for each category and this year’s recipients were chosen based on each individual's impact on the organization they work for, the complexity of the issue they addressed, and their work with the community, or open source contributions. The final awardees ranked in the top 15 percent of their respective categories.
