## 5th Annual DCFemTech Awards Recognize 49 Influentials in Code, Data and Design

_Record Number of Nominations Reflects Burgeoning Inclusive Tech Community_

**May 23, 2019 — Washington, DC —**[DCFemTech](https://dcfemtech.com), the coalition of leaders aimed at amplifying local women in tech organizations by lowering the barriers to entry and increasing opportunities for career growth, today recognized 49 women and nonbinary individuals as 2019 DCFemTech Award recipients. These awards recognize the talented, passionate women behind the screens who are creating and making a difference in their organizations and communities. On June 17, the organization and its members will host a reception at The Hamilton Live to celebrate the recipients and nominees.

Nominations for outstanding women in code, design and data opened on March 6 at the organization’s annual Inspire event, an evening dedicated to encouraging women to share and celebrate accomplishments from the previous year. The organization received a record 704 nominations, representing a nearly 80 percent increase in nominations from two years prior.

"These incredible recipients and the hundreds of nominees represent a vibrant community of talented women in the District of Columbia," said DC Government CTO Lindsey Parker. “While DC is ahead of the curve with the community and resources available for women in technology, efforts like this will only continue to make the district a more welcoming and inclusive environment.”

DCFemTech works to support organizations that enable women to build their skills and create communities while also encouraging companies to make it a priority to hire talented women coders, designers, data scientists and other tech leaders.

"DC was again ranked as the best city in the country for women in technology in 2019, and DCFemTech is a significant factor towards that," said Deputy Mayor Brian Kenner. “We are thrilled to recognize the individuals who make this community so vibrant and attractive for continued investment. A positive community for women in technology is not only inherently good, it will continue to help the DC economy grow by attracting top talent and innovative companies.”

Nominations were selected by a committee of 45 judges comprised of engineers, designers, data scientists, and executives for each category and this year’s recipients were chosen based on each woman’s impact on the organization they work for, the complexity of the issue they addressed, and their work with the community, or open source contributions. The final awardees ranked in the top 20 percent of their respective categories.
