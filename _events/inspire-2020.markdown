Several companies have cancelled travel and events out of concern for limiting the spread of coronavirus. Our host of next week's event is one of them and unfortunately we will not be able to hold Inspire on Thursday.

Rather than scramble to find another venue one week out, **we are going to cancel Inspire** and focus our efforts on our upcoming awards program.

Sorry â€” we were really looking forward to it, too!

We usually open nominations the night of Inspire, but why wait? [Nominations for the DCFemTech Awards are NOW OPEN!](https://dcfemtech.typeform.com/to/cKmMF7)

Know an amazing woman who codes, designs or works with data? Are you one? Nominate yourself or others for the DCFemTech Awards. **Get your nominations in by April 8th!**
